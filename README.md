# Fine_Particoular_Matter_Air_Pollution

We made an analysis on PM2.5 in USA, in order to understand if air pollution levels decreased between 1999 and 2012. 

We used R and RStudio for coding. 
The main file is casestudy.R, but you will also need MyUtils.R, Costanti.R and all "dati" directory, where are stored our raw data. At the beginning, when you run casestudy.R, the application will ask you the project path where you should put MyUtils.R, Costanti.R and the "dati" directory.

All other informations are reported in "Relazione.pdf" file.
